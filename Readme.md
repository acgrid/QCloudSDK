# QCloud SDK for PHP
 A composer library for interacting QCloud APIs.
 
 Inspired by @overture's awesome EasyWeChat.
 
 Created for personal project use. Do not ask me to implement this or that. Contribution is welcome and what I want to say is PSR-2.
 
 Requires PHP7. Go to Tencent's official SDKs if you are still stuck in PHP5.
