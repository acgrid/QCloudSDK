# QCloud SDK for PHP
 A composer library for using QCloud APIs and callbacks.
 
 Inspired by awesome EasyWeChat by @overture.
 
 Created for personal project use. Do not ask me to implement this or that. Contribution is welcome and what I want to say is trying to conform PSR and avoid warnings from IDEs.

 Requires PHP7. Documentations and tests are incomplete.
  
 Tencent's official SDKs are welcome to you if you are still stuck in PHP5 and loving `require_once`.
